  abstract = {Variations in solar radiation can produce noise in readings from gauge pressure transducers when the transducer cable is exposed to direct sunlight. This noise is a result of insolation-induced heating and cooling of the air column in the vent tube of the transducer cable. A controlled experiment was performed to assess the impact of variations in solar radiation on transducer readings. This experiment demonstrated that insolation-induced fluctuations in apparent pressure head can be as large as 0.03 m. The magnitude of these fluctuations is dependent on cable color, the diameter of the vent tube, and the length of the transducer cable. The most effective means of minimizing insolationinduced noise is to use integrated transducer-data logger units that fit within a well. Failure to address this source of noise can introduce considerable uncertainty into analyses of hydraulic tests when the head change is relatively small, as is often the case for tests in highly permeable aquifers or for tests using distant observation wells.},

  abstract = {The use of diurnal water-table fluctuation methods to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater flow is of increasing interest in ecohydrological studies. Most studies of this type, however, have been located in riparian wetlands of semi-arid regions where groundwater levels are consistently below topographic surface elevations and precipitation events are infrequent. Current methodologies preclude application to a wider variety of wetland systems. In this study, we extended a method for estimating sub-daily ET and groundwater flow rates from water-level fluctuations to fit highly dynamic, non-riparian wetland scenarios. Modifications included (1) varying the specific yield to account for periodic flooded conditions and (2) relating empirically derived ET to estimated potential ET for days when precipitation events masked the diurnal signal. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we estimated ET and groundwater fluxes over two growing seasons (2006\textendash 2007) in 15 wetlands within a ridge-and-swale wetland complex of the Laurentian Great Lakes under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Mean daily ET rates for the sites ranged from 4.0 mm d\`A1 to 6.6 mm d\`A1. Shallow groundwater discharge rates resulting from evaporative demand ranged from 2.5 mm d\`A1 to 4.3 mm d\`A1. This study helps to expand our understanding of the evapotranspirative demand of plants under various hydrologic and climate conditions. Published 2013.

  abstract = {Diurnal variations in streamflow (DVS) have been studied in detail by underwater pressure loggers. Some of this equipment requires barometric compensation with a logger or sensor located outside the water. Studies related to this topic have not offered a critical report of the validity of patterns inferred with these instruments. While studying a forested watershed in Southern Chile (40\textdegree{} S), we detected a DVS when the external logger was placed 1.5 m above ground, under a marked diurnal fluctuation in air temperature (amplitude 12.4 \textdegree C) and a dampened fluctuation in stream temperature (amplitude 1.4 \textdegree C). Synchronization was apparent between air and stream temperature in a direct relationship, but the synchronization between air/stream temperature and streamflow was negative, with some hours of lag time. In laboratory experiments, when the external logger is considerably warmer than the water-level logger, depth measurements can be underestimated by up to 1.5 cm. When the opposite occurs, water depths can be overestimated by up to 0.9 cm and are large instrumental/methodological artifacts compared to the field water diurnal variation of 1.3 cm. Finally, we relocated the external logger in front of the water-level logger and inside a weir, but exposed to the air. Results confirmed the pattern previously detected in the field, but streamflow fluctuations were 19\% less accentuated. We conclude that the incorrect placement of the external logger, along with an instrumental artifact, can intensify a DVS pattern.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods based on diurnal water level (surface or groundwater) fluctuations are sensitive to measurement accuracy (McLaughlin and Cohen, 2011; Cuevas et al., 2010). Water level fluctuations are often measured by pressure transducers of varying design and precision. Available total pressure transducers require a compensation for barometric pressure change supplied by barometric pressure transducers. Recently McLaughlin and Cohen (2011) as well as Cuevas et al. (2010) analyzed the `thermal artifacts' of such transducer-pair data questioning the applicability of sub-daily water level measurements in non-buffered thermal mode for diurnal ET estimation. Similar problems should not, in principle, occur for so-called vented pressure transducers. With the help of ancillary manual measurements, this study verifies the accuracy of vented pressure transducer obtained ultrafine scale (temporal resolution of 1\textendash 10 min) stream- and groundwater level data. Thermal effects were examined by a statistical analysis of concurrent water level and temperature data. The results support the thermal artifact-free nature of vented pressure transducers and therefore their suitability for diurnal ET estimation purposes when proper maintenance and periodic calibrations are provided. In the lack of such measures, diurnal temperature changes can induce errors in vented pressure transducer readings as well.},

Together with a digital data logger, it is a convenient way to record water level fluctuations for long-term monitoring. Despite the wide use of pressure transducers for water level monitoring, little has been reported regarding their accuracy and performance under field conditions. The effects of temperature fluctuations on the output of vented pressure transducers were considered in this study. The pressure transducers were tested under both laboratory and field conditions. The results of this study indicate that temperature fluctuation has a strong effect on the transducer output. Rapid changes in temperature introduce noise and fluctuations in the water level readings under a constant hydraulic head while the absolute temperature is also related to sensor errors. The former is attributed to venting and the latter is attributed to temperature compensation effects in the strain gauges. Individual pressure transducers responded differently to the thermal fluctuations in the same testing environment. In the field of surface hydrology, especially when monitoring fine-scale water level fluctuations, ignoring or failing to compensate for the temperature effect can introduce considerable error into pressure transducer readings. It is recommended that a performance test for the pressure transducer is conducted before field deployment.},

  abstract = {The White method, routinely used to estimate phreatophyte transpiration from diel groundwater variation, also provides measures of total evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater fluxes in surface waters. Such applications remain rare, however, and critically require accurate representation of stage-dependent variation in specific yield (Sy). High-resolution stage data from three Florida swamps were used to evaluate different relationships between Sy and stage (ecosystem specific yield, ESY). A discretized form, ESYD, assumes constant Sy near unity for inundated conditions, applying soil Sy for belowground stage and open water Sy (Sy,OW \% 1.0) for aboveground stage. A mixture approach, ESYM, applies a stage-dependent interpolation between Sy,Soil and Sy,OW using stage-area relationships and assumes rapid lateral equilibration between inundated and non-inundated wetland areas. Finally, an empirical formulation, ESYRR, uses measured ratios of rain to rise to estimate stage-specific Sy. All formulations yielded reasonable ET rates (ET \% PET) at high stage; ESYD markedly overestimated ET (ET/PET {$>$} 3) at intermediate stage, whereas ESYM and ESYRR maintained ET/PET near 1.0. Estimated groundwater fluxes using ESYM and ESYRR correlated well with Darcy-estimated flows, but were larger, likely due to uncertainties in Darcy parameters. Well transects across wetlands documented equal water elevation and diel variation across inundated and non-inundated areas, verifying rapid equilibration that reduces Sy and explaining overestimation by ESYD. However, equilibration area varied within and among wetlands, explaining observed differences between ESYM and ESYRR, and suggesting ESYRR may be preferred. Stage histograms followed the shape of ESYRR, highlighting reciprocal influences of ESY on stage stability. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Many watershed studies rely on pressure transducers to measure and report stream and groundwater levels in order to characterize the hydrology of the region. The accuracy of pressure transducers in some applications have recently been questioned in studies reporting artificially exaggerated high or low pressure readings that cannot be explained by daily hydrological fluctuations. In a watershed field investigation, data analyses have revealed, for some sensors, patterns of artificial changes in stream and groundwater levels as a function of water and atmospheric temperature. These patterns do not follow the expected variation that could be caused by natural phenomena (i.e. changes in head caused by evapotranspiration). Laboratory analyses of temperatureinduced artificial pressure changes reproduces this error and yielded functional relationships for thermal artifact corrections. Using these relationships, stream and groundwater levels can be back-calculated yielding a more accurate watershed hydrologic characterization. By removing the thermal artifacts from laboratory and field data, errors are reduced by up to 65\% (laboratory) and 81\% (field data). The developed procedure can be used in other settings where pressure transducers are used, such as studies in rainfall/runoff variations, runoff measurements in urban settings, and the impacts of new development in rural watersheds.},

The ecohydrological response of forested wetlands following a canopy disturbance has the potential to affect critical ecosystem services, and the degree of this effect may largely depend on the wetland's hydrogeological setting. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the hydrologic connectivity of uninfested black ash wetlands and evaluate the water table response to a simulated EAB disturbance. We hypothesized that black ash wetlands in northern Michigan were (a) seasonally connected to, and derived the majority of their water from groundwater, and (b) wetland water tables would be elevated following a simulated EAB infestation due to decreased transpiration with the loss of black ash. The results indicate that the black ash wetland sites received most of their water from groundwater discharge. Significantly smaller site transpiration fluxes and significantly slower rates of drawdown were detected during the growing season in the girdled and ash-cut treatment sites, and these responses collectively produced significantly elevated wetland water tables when compared to control sites in the latter portions of the growing season. However, the wetlands' strong connection with groundwater sources likely buffered the magnitude of hydrological responses associated with the loss of black ash from the landscape.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration rates (ET) from contrasting Wisconsin bogs (one forested bog, one open bog) were compared over 4 years by analyzing diel oscillations of their water tables. Daily rates of ET from peatlands were also compared to rates of evaporation (E) from encircled bog ponds. We hypothesized that ET would be higher in the forested bog due to the greater leaf area index of forest canopy relative to moss and ericaceous shrubs. We also hypothesized that ET in peatlands would exceed the physical process of E from encircled ponds. Field data supported the first hypothesis, but the second only proved true for the forested peatland. Daily estimates of peatland ET varied widely, ranging from \textasciitilde 1 to {$>$}10 mm/d; but average ET was higher in the forested peatland (4.04 vs. 3.09 mm/d; p {$<$} .01). Average ET in the forested peatland was also higher than E during summer (4.04 vs. 3.31 mm/d; p {$<$} .05); whereas in the open peatland, average ET was slightly lower than E for all measured seasons (p {$<$} .01). Methodologically, the performance of three equations used to estimate ET from daily water table fluctuations was similar. The specific yield of peat (S*y), which is a critical variable in all three equations, was found to be an exponential function of water table depth; and absent an empirically derived S*y, errors in estimates of peatland ET can be large. Given landscape composition across this northern temperate region (13\% lakes, 20\% peatland, and 54\% upland forest) and estimates of forest ET gleaned from the literature, our findings suggest that the regional feedback of water to the atmosphere increases from open waters to peatlands to upland forest, consistent with prior observations that the biological process of transpiration dominates continental ET.},
