# Notes

Say if the manufacturers state the source of the errors. What causes the error,
and why do I need to still compensate for it.

Figure 1 explanation: state more clearly that it is two interacting errors, not
delta T. State how some models may not be counteracting, but instead will be
compounding

Figure 3: Add panel C showing what is in Panel 4. Panel A + Panel B = Panel C.
Panel B shows no pattern and errors within range of instrument error, might be
good to build up into a relationship for Figure 1

Put uncertainty things first in the introduction and methods. Expand uncertainty
in introduction. In other words, focus on the uncertainty discussion and what it
means for diurnal signals. That is the novel work

# Introduction

Hydrologic monitoring for research and management, including monitoring wells,
piezometers, and stream discharge, often utilizes submerged pressure-transducer
to measure water levels. These instruments are easy to deploy, require minimum
access to the instrument, and provide long-term continuous records in an easily
analyzed format via on-board datalogging. They have been developed in two major
configurations: absolute or unvented, and gauge or vented. Absolute transducers
measure pressure relative to some fixed pressure contained on one side of a
flexible membrane. Gauge transducers measure pressure across a similar membrane
relative to a chamber connected to the atmosphere via a vent tube. Speaking
generally of pressure transducers in hydrologic monitoring, it has been pointed
out that "these systems commonly are not adequately supported by
quality-assurance procedures." [@freeman-2004, p. 1]. And upon studying the
impacts of temperature and temperature gradients on water level measurement
errors @liu-2015 (p. 72) concluded that "measurement of the
water level...is not simple". Even the relatively simple task of measuring water
level in a tank may be confounded by propagating instrument uncertainty through 
to final water levels [@tamari-2010]. 

In the above quote @liu-2015 were commenting on additional uncertainty that
absolute temperature and temperature gradients introduce into water level
measurements. @freeman-2004 went highlighted water temperature gradients as a
potential source of error, and in the same year @cain-2004 examined
temperature-derived artifacts within gauge transducers. Within absolute
transducers artifacts were shown to arise from the temperature of instrument
[@moore-2016], as well as from differing thermal regimes between barometric and
water pressure instruments [@cuevas-2010; @mclaughlin-2011]. @liu-2015 and 
@moore-2016 go on to suggest that all transducers be tested for inaccuracies
over the range of temperature measurements and individual compensation equations
be developed to apply to collected data.

@mclaughlin-2011 concluded that temperature differentials between water and
barometric pressure measurements introduced detectable artifacts with a 1.5 cm
increase in the diurnal variation. This result is similar to @cuevas-2010, who
found a 19% increase in streamflow diurnal fluctuation when barometric and water
transducers were deployed in different thermal settings. Both
@mclaughlin-2011 and @cuevas-2010 focused on absolute transducers, but similar
work has also been performed using vented gauge transducers. @cain-2004 found
that temperature changes within the vent-tube of gauge pressure transducers
introduce water level artifacts, which was explored further by
@liu-2015 in multi-day laboratory and long-term field experiments. Their
findings show that errors can be introduced due to water temperature or rapid
fluctuations in air temperature. Their laboratory experiment found 1.4
$mm^oC^{-1}$ error as water temperature changed (with constant air temperature).
These corrections corresponded to errors of up to 7mm in their field
experiments, with at least some of that error due to the rate of temperature
change affecting the connection to the atmosphere via the vent tube. We can
expect that errors will be introduced with more rapid temperature fluctuations
They also highlight the impact of rate of temperature change, with more rapid
gradients inducing larger water level errors. Errors due to rapid temperature
flucations can be expected to affect both absolute and gauge transducers as
internal electronics and membranes must equilibrate to the new temperatures
[@freeman-2004].

Based on those studies the potential sources of error for absolute transducers 
are the water temperature, the air temperature, the difference between water and
air temperature, and the rate of change for both water and air temperature. 
Previous studies have examined absolute transducer error due to individual 
transducer error [@moore-2016] and due to temperature differences between transducers [@mclaughlin-2011]. @liu-2015 lays out the underlying physics that could lead to 
gauge transducer errors when a temperature difference exists along the vent tube.
There is no analagous physical process for absolute transducers, which suggests 
that errors assumed to arise from temperature differences in these studies may 
be misattributed. We present the alternative hypothesis that that perceived 
temperature difference error is the combination of individual transducer 
responses to water and air temperatures (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-1)). 
The out of phase variation in air temperature and water temperature result in 
the stronger gradient masking the effect of the weaker gradient. The sequential 
correction shown in Figure \@ref{fig:figure-1} illustrates how both errors must 
be addressed. There are two possible approaches to the correction. Develop univariate 
corrections to some reference pressure measurement for each transducer, or develop
a single multi-variate correction for each pair of air and water transducers. By
developing a single multi-variate correction we can avoid the need to determine
a suitable reference pressure measurement or utilize a pressure chamber.

__Figure 1 should be what the description of figure 3 above says. Show error 
from air temp and uncorrected error from water temp. Then show error as corrected
for air and water temp.__

```{r figure-1, fig.cap="Figure 1: Water level error as function of water temperature recorded by the instrument. The line sequential connects the data point and the line color indicates the temperature difference between the water and air. The black point represents the start of the experimental period with a clockwise hystersis loop. The dashed lines represent the combined errors of the water pressure transducer and F3311 barometric sensor."}

```

Implied in the above studies is additional error, beyond instrument accuracy,
that should be considered in the estimate of total measurement uncertainty. It
is also clear that temperature-induced errors will be most apparent in field
data when examining diurnal signals. Many studies have relied on the diurnal
signal in well water levels and streamflow to estimate evapotranspiration and
groundwater flow [@carlsonmazur-2014;
@kirchner-2009; @loheide-2005; @mclaughlin-2014; @watras-2017; @white-1932].
Ignoring errors in diurnal signals will lead to additional skewed results as the
initial inaccuracies compound. Therefore, correcting for temperature-induced
errors is essential to ensure that the observed fluctuations are real and not an
artifact. Cuevas [-@cuevas-2010] and Gribovszki [-@gribovszki-2013] do validate
their measurements with manual readings over the course of at least one 24-hour
period. To be fully effective in field studies, these types of diurnal
fluctuation validations would have to happen across the range of temperature and
evapotranspiration/groundwater measurements throughout the monitoring period.
This is often unfeasible for reasons related, but not limited to, budget,
logistics, and safety. This leaves laboratory-derived compensation equations as
the best alternative option, as recommended by Moore [-@moore-2016] and Liu
[-@liu-2015].

While compensation equations can provide more assurance that observed diurnal
signals are real, they introduce addtional error beyond instrument accuracy,
that should be considered in the estimate of total measurement uncertainty. No
studies to date examining the combined impact of instrument error and
compensation equation uncertainty have been carried out to estimate the full
uncertainty of measurements. In order to assess the validity of diurnal signals
within water level measurements, any uncertainty in correcting the intra- and
inter-transducer artifacts, should be propagated through to the final water
level record. Such propagated uncertainty will provide a detection limit for
true diurnal signals. Without additional validation (through manual measurements
or other instrumentation), diurnal patterns below this detection limit must be
considered artifacts. As such we suggest that estimates of diurnal signal should
be analyzed as a left-censored dataset, with the detection limit determined by
the specifics of instrumentation and compensation equations.

In this note we present a lab experiment to isolate and correct the separate
impacts of transducer response to water and air temperatures. We demonstrate how
these effects may mask one another resulting in water level errors within the
range of instrument error. We present the corrected and uncorrected water levels
on a test set of laboratory data at as well representative data from an ongoing
hydrologic field study. Finally we calculate the propagated uncertainty, compare
this to instrument error, and evaluate both against published diurnal water
level fluctuations.

# Materials and Methods

## Data Collection & Preparation

### Laboratory Data

We have conducted a five day-long experiment recording constant water levels 
using absolute pressure transducers in four thermal settings to determine the
impact of varying water and air temperatures, and temperature difference. The
thermal settings represent a fully crossed design with stable and variable
temperatures and similar and dissimilar air and water thermal regimes. Eighteen
pressure transducers of varying age and model, all manufactured by Solinst, Ltd.
(Georgetown, ON, Canada), were used to record water levels
(Table \@ref(tab:loggers)). Two of these transducers, both Solinst Levellogger Juniors,
were used to monitor barometric pressure. All instruments contained an absolute
pressure transducer, temperature sensor, and on-board data logging. These loggers
also provide internal temperature compensation of pressure measurements. 

```{r experiments, eval = FALSE}
experiments <- 
  data.table(Experiment = c("stat-sim", "stat-dis", "var-sim", "var-dis", "test-data"),
             Temperature = c("Stable", "Stable", "Variable", "Variable", "Variable"),
             `Air/Water Temperature Differential` = c("Similar", "Dissimilar", "Similar", "Dissimilar", "Dissimilar"))

knitr::kable(experiments,
             align = "c",
             caption = "Description of experimental conditions.")
```

             align = "c",
             caption = "Summary of pressure transducer model type, measurement resolution, and associated errors expressed as standard deviation, derived from manufacturer stated 99% instrument accuracy.")
```

Water level transducers were suspended from a brace across a large container
with the transducers zero points aligned. The transducers were covered with a
fixed depth of water and a layer of canola oil was added to prevent evaporation
over the length of the experiment. Water level was measured at the start and end
of the experimental period to confirm no evaporation. To provide thermally
similar air and water environments we placed a graduated cylinder in the center
of the water. The cylinder was partially filled with gravel and water to
counteract the buoyancy of the cylinder. During the two periods with synchronous
thermal regimes the two barometric transducers were suspended directly above the
gravel surface. The entire apparatus was covered loosely with aluminum foil to
prevent direct wind effects. For stable thermal regimes the experiment was
conducted in a non-climate controlled basement to minimize diurnal temperature
fluctuations. Varying thermal regime periods were conducted outdoors, out of
direct solar radiation. The barometric transducers were placed under a black
radiation shield to magnify temperature differentials and purposely induce
errors from rapid temperature fluctuations [@liu-2015]. Compensation models 
(below) were developed using one day of recorded data in the variable, dissimilar
conditions. Compensation model performance was than evaluated against the 
remaining data to evaluate the impact of compensation under various transducer
deployment scenarios.

Transducers were deployed and data retrieved using using Solinst Levellogger v.
4.4.0 software. Transducers were set to record at 1-minute intervals with time
synchronized to computer time at launch. The four experiments were run serially
without retrieving data from the Transducers A settling time of at least 30
minutes was observed after barometric transducers or entire experimental apparatus
were relocated, and exact experiment start and end times were determined in a
post-hoc manner to ensure a suitable setting period.

### Field Data

A sample of representative data were taken from ongoing hydrologic field
research. These data are from a study in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan
in sites located in black ash wetlands. Details on the hydrology of these sites
can be found in Van Grinsven _et al_ [-@vangrinsven-2017]. The data used in this
analysis are from well water levels collected from a 1.25" driven monitoring
well in a wetland and a 6" parshall flume on an intermittent stream which serves 
as the outflow of this headwater wetland. Well level, flume level, and barometric
data were collected with instruments ######, ######, and ###### respectively. 
Data were collected between ########## and ######## and recorded at 15-minute 
intervals.

## Water Level Compensation

All of the sensors used in this study are designed to measure pressure at a
relatively constant temperature and utilize a fixed water density of 1000 $kg
m^{-3}$ to convert pressure to depth (Personal Communication, Solinst). To
account for the larger range of temperatures observed in this study the recorded
pressure was adjusted to account for the variable density of water. 
$$P_{c} = P\;\mathsf{x}\;\frac{\rho_o}{\rho_T}$$ 
where $\rho_T$ is the density of water ($kg m^) as a
function of temperature taken from [@tanaka-2001, Eq. 1], $\rho_o$ is the assumed
density of water (1000 $kgm^{-3}$, and _P_ and $P_c$ are the observed and 
density-corrected pressure readings in units of depth (cm for this study). Here 
after all references to transducer pressure will refer to the density-compensated
pressure. 

Depth of water ($W_d$) was measured separately for each transducer from the water 
surface to the transducer zero point. Raw water level was calculate for each
water and air transducer pair (n = 36) as the absolute measured water pressure 
minus the absolute air pressure ($L = P_w - P_a$). Water level error 
($\epsilon_L$) was calcuated as calculated water level minus measured water 
depth.

To perform compensation without utilizing a reference pressure, a multivariate
ordinary least squares model was pair of water and air transducers. The 36 models
took the form 

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_L=\beta_0 + \beta_aT_a + \beta_wT_w + \beta_{\Delta T_a}\Delta T_a
(\#eq:comp-base)
\end{equation}

where $T_a$, $T_w$, and $\Delta T_a$ represent air temperature, water temperature,
and change in air temperature ($^oC\;min^{-1}$) respectively. 

To avoid compensating unimpacted loggers, all $\beta$ terms with a p-value > 0.05 were 
set to zero prior to applying the compensation to the test data. For each 
water-air transducer pair the correct compensation model was used to predict the 
error ($\hat\epsilon_L$), which was used to compensate the recorded water levels 
such that
$$L_c = L - \hat\epsilon_L$$
where $L_c$ denotes the compensated water level. Both $L$ and $L_c$ were then
centered by subtracting the mean of $\epsilon_L$ and $\hat\epsilon_L$, 
respectively.

Equation \@ref{eq:comp-base} was fit to the observed data to evaluate the
hypothesis of a single multivariate compensation equation derived from only from
known water depth. To account for the uncertainty of instrument error in the
temperature compensation models, Equation 2 was fit repeatedly using a
bootstrapping appraoch. For each transducer pair 1000 models were run. Input
data from the models were taken as random samples from a distrubtion centered on
the observed data with a standard deviation derived from the stated accuracy of
the instruments (Table \@ref{tab-loggers}).

\begin{equation}
\tau_L \sim N(\epsilon_L, \sigma_{L'});\;\sigma_{L'} = \sqrt{2\sigma_L^2}\\
\tau_a \sim N(T_a, \sigma_T)\\
\tau_w \sim N(T_w, \sigma_T)\\
\tau_{\Delta_{T_a}} \sim N(\Delta T_a, \sigma_{T'});\;\sigma_{T'} = \sqrt{2\sigma_T^2}\\

\tau_L=\beta_0 + \beta_a\tau_a + \beta_w\tau_w + \beta_{\Delta T_a}\tau_{\Delta{T_a}}
(\#eq:comp-boot)
\end{equation}

where $\tau_*$ represents the randomly generated value of each parameter.
Predicted values for the test data were generated for each model by sampling
from a random distrubtion with mean equal to the expected value and a standard
deviation equivalent to the square root of the mean square error of the model.
$$\hat\epsilon_{L_i} \sim N(\tau_L, \sigma_{model})$$,
where $$\hat\epsilon_{L_i}$$ is the predicted error for the _i_th record.
The predicted error was taken as the median of all calcualted
$\hat\epsilon_{L_i}$ with upper and lower credibile intervals taken as the 0.025
and 0.975 quantiles of all calcualted $\hat\epsilon_{L_i}$. Total uncertainty
was partitioned into instrument and compensation errors by subtracting the
stated instrument uncertainty.

## Compensation Evaluation

To ensure independent evaluation of compensation, the accuracy of the models were
evaluated using the 4 days of data from each of the experimental periods described
above. Compensation were evaluated based on two criteria: number of
recorded points which fell outside of the range of combined instrument errors
($n_{\epsilon,i}$) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) from the true values 
as a percentage of the true value. Effect of compensation was tested as the
pairwise difference in estimated
marginal means of the MAD for corrected and uncorrected data within a given experimental period. 
with a post-hoc Tukey HSD analysis to compare between correction methods.

The purpose of developing transducer compensations is to correct field-collected
data where true water level is unknown except for a relatively small collection
of manual calibration reading. Representative data from
ongoing field research using these same instruments is evaluated using raw and
compensated water levels. As true water depth was known for so few of the
recorded water level measurements, $n_{\epsilon,i}$ and MAD were not calculated.
Rather key charactersitics of the resulting time series, magnitude of the 
diurnal fluctuation, timing of water level peaks and drawdown, and daily summary
statistics, are compared. These metrics were chosen to illustrate the impact of
compensation on common metrics used in reported hydrologic data.

## Software
All data processing and analysis was performed in R [@rcoreteam-2019] using the
packages `data.table` [@dowle-2019] for data manipulation, `ggplot2`
[@wickham-2016] and `patchwork` [@pedersen-2019a] for visualization, `fixest`
[@berge-2018] for linear models, and `httr` [@wickham-2019a] for Mesonet API
access and caching. The `drake` [@landau-2018], `rmarkdown` [@allaire-2020;
@xie-2018], `rticles` [@allaire-2019], and `rbbt` [@dunnington-2020] packages
were used to generate a reproducible project and publication.


# Results

## Compensation
All of the thirty-six final models fit using Equation \@ref{eq:comp-base}
showed a good fit to the data ($R^2$ __paste("$", round(mean(mods$r2), 2),
"\\pm", round(sd(mods$r2)/sqrt(length(mods$r2)), 3), "$")__). Root-mean squared
errors for the models ranged from #### to #### cm. The bootstrap predictions 
had RMSE values that ranged from #### to #### cm, which includes the uncertainty
inherent in the uncertainty of instrument measurements. The median absolute 
deviation from true water level showed a mean change of -0.014, -0.042, 0.075, and 
-0.673 cm within the _stat-sim_, _stat_dis_, _var-sim_, and
_var-dis_ experimental periods. The reduction in MAD for the _stat-dis_ and 
_var-dis_ period were significant at the $\alpha=0.05$ level, as was the increase
in MAD in the _var-sim_ period. The number of transducer pairs with points that 
fell outside of the instrument error range was reduced 

Prior to compensation #### +/- ##### points fell
outside of the 95% confidence band defined by the true water level +/-
qnorm(0.975) times the combined instrument errors of the barometric and water
pressure transducers. Following compensation #### points fell outside of that
same confidence band. When the interval is expanded to include to instrument
uncertainty and the temperature compensation #### and #### points of the raw and
compensated data, respectively, fell outside the interval.

## Uncertainty Analysis

We saw that the different thermal regimes in the experiments could still be 
explained by a single unified model.

There should be some variability in the error around points, and if I can 
demonstrate how that varies with the difference between air and water temperature
then I could actually quantify the uncertainty you add to your measurements when
you do not have your loggers in thermally similar regimes

# Conclusions

Our results show that for absolute pressure transducers error is introduced
primarily through independent water and air temperature errors. Correcting for
water level error using temperature difference would disregard the differential 
transducer responses. By using the models developed in this study it is possible
to look at the impact of considering temperature differential relative to 
absolute temperature. Figure ### shows the result of simulating errors using a 
fixed water temperature and varying air temperature, and fixed temperatuer 
differential between varying air and water temperatures. We can see that the
two sources of errors move in opposite directions, and in general the effect of
air temperature along is much larger than the effect of a moving temperature 
differential window. 

We also showed that it is possible to correct water-depth derived from two
pressure transducers without the need to reference to an external data source.
Any transducer compensation approach must be a trade-off between convenience,
absolute accuracy, and uncertainty. The described approach to compensation
achieves accuracy that corrects most data to within the bounds instrument error.
It can be performed with at a monitoring location with little to no extra
equipment. By minimizing the number of models required for compensation the
multivariate constant water-depth approach also reduces the uncertainty added to
the final water depth measurement. A similar error reduction was performed using
external barometric data and correcting each transducer type separately (data
not shown). These data showed a similar improvement in accuracy but with added
uncertainty from additional compensation models and additional instrument error.

Both @cain-2004 and @liu-2015 recommend that lab-based compensation equations be
developed for deployed transducers. Building upon that we have demonstrated that
it is possible to develop a single lab-based correction suitable for varied
deployment environments. However, developing a compensation equation under
conditions similar to field conditions may be more desireable. The need for
regularization in the compensation models illustrates that there is a risk for
overfitting compensation models to test conditions. This issue was especially
clear in the *var-sim* conditions, where we observed a small but significant
increase in RMSE for corrected water levels. We believe that the inaccuracies
arise from the internal temperature compensation of the pressure transducers.
The data used to train our models were purposefully collected under the most
extreme conditions, with large, rapid temperature fluctuations in the barometric
and water pressure readings. Under these conditions the internal temperature
compensation algorithm is likely overwhelmed. Under conditions with smaller,
slower temperature fluctations, the compensation models tend to overcorrect the
data because the internal temperature compensation has already dampened the
temperature-induced errors. If measurement conditions are similar to compensation
conditions, an OLS regression approach would likely provide improved accuracy at
the expense of generalizability. Idenitying the need for regularization in the
compensation illustrates the importance of using an independent dataset to 
validate compensation models. Use of multiple independent validation sets also
allow for the creation of a single model for situations where monitoring 
conditions may vary significantly. 

The majority of errors in this study are attributable to (**expand with 
specifics**) individual transducer The barometric transducer 1065861 appears to be 
more sensitive to high rates of temperature change, as can be seen in Figure ####,
leading to larger errors at the beginning and end of the *var-dis* period. 
Transducers #### and #### also show larger errors, and account for all of the
increase in OOR measurements in the *var-sim* period. The approach laid out 
above could, and should, be used to tune the compensation for individual loggers.
That scale of tuning is outside of the scope of this paper, which is instead 
focused on commonalities in compensation that can be applied across instruments
and manufacturers. 

Regularization penalizes variabiles with large slopes. This results in models
that are less prone to overfitting and to being driven entirely by a single
variable. It also has the effective of making the models less sensitive to
predictors. This can be seen in Figure #### where the penalized model from above
is compared to a OLS model with the same form fit to the training data. In the
training data, error is further reduced from the regularized model, but
increases when examining the testing data.



Highlight areas where different artifacts are present. Then it can be a guide
for where people should at their data to find artifacts.

Separate out sensor-specific corrections vs generic corrections. Do any appear
to be



**Why Perform these Corrections?**
One could argue that it’s not worth the additional uncertainty for a reduction
in points outside of the measurement error range. There are three arguments
against this. The first is the idealistic argument that we should want the
correct data for the correct reason. Have measurements stay within the error
bounds due to competing biases is not a good strategy from an idealistic or a
pragmatic view. The points that are most likely to lie outside of the error
bounds have the greatest temperature difference between transducers or show the
fastest rate of change. These are often significant events: changes in flow
following a storm or periods of peak ET where water temperature and air
temperature are likely to be at their maximum. Building on these two reasons is
that an understanding of the true uncertainty of  measured data will allow more
critical and accurate interpretation. How strong are the diurnal signals in
relation to known uncertainty.



Temperature compensation could be overstated based on the time scale of the
study. Would have to know how quickly Solinst changes temperatures in their
calibrations. [@freeman-2004] talks about this stating that it could be a rate
of change issue and/or the fact that parts of the electronics may change
temperatures at different times. Relatedly, it is important to note that these
rapid temperature changes were short-lived and the offset of the $\Delta T$
models may decline over time much as an intervention effect in a time series
model. We tested this on inter-experiment data excluded from this analysis and
found that ... (move from outside to inside for stat-dis and the long gradual
decrease in temperature after a short rapid change)

One final note, the authors have chosen to focus on trend correction rather than
offset. In general systematic offsets are corrected through manual calibration
measurements during deployment. If deployed conditions will not allow for manual
calibration measurements, the above approaches are applicable, but offsets must
be carefully calculated, which may require external pressure measurements as a
reference.

I cannot compare if the water level errors are of fixed magnitude or percentage
based. I could make some educated guess from the barometric transducers though.

FIGURE: Create point-range plots of published water level fluctuation rates. Then
add in a threshold line for the median prediction-interval range from this study
to see how often these values could be artifacts and not true measurements

The median absolute deviation was correlated with ..., 
indicating that is the largest source of error.

## Recommendations

- We have shown that even with the added uncertainty of rectified barometric
pressure we can provide water level compensations that match those from an
external, reference source. However it is important that during data processing
other stations were found to have different slopes for temperature correction 
models. For use in future work it is recommended that the relationship be 
developed individually for any external stations that may be used to back-fill
missing experimental or monitoring data. Or inversely that back-fill sources
are corrected to match your pressure transducers.

- For each new transducer check for *all* potential error-inducing sources. Each 
transducer should be checked for temperature gradients, temperature difference
gradients to reference values, and rate of change of temperature or pressure

- In this study no mean offset was necessary to account for persistent pressure
errors due to rapid water temperature changes. This is likely because of the
buffered $\Delta T_w$ relative to $\Delta T_a$. In setting where rapid changes
in water temperature are possible calibration should consider including a
persistent impact.

- Develop instrument specific compensation models in similar settings to data
collection. Ideally a known-water level reference model would be developed with
the loggers in situ at the monitoring site. (Describe dry-well deployment)

- Compensation is essential when transducers are deployed in settings with 
variable conditions.

- Even without additional compensation errors, instrument errors can cause errors
of the same order of magnitude as previously published reports

- Do this type of calibration at your field location if possible. Also perform
multiple times in different conditions if possible.

Equation in German-born physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special
relativity that showed that the increased relativistic mass ($m$) of a
body comes from the energy of motion of the body—that is, its kinetic
energy ($E$)—divided by the speed of light squared ($c^2$).
