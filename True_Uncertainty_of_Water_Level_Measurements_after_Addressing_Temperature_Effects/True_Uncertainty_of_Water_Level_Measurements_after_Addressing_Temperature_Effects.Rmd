# Notes

Say if the manufacturers state the source of the errors. What causes the error,
and why do I need to still compensate for it.

Figure 1 explanation: state more clearly that it is two interacting errors, not
delta T. State how some models may not be counteracting, but instead will be
compounding

Panel B shows no pattern and errors within range of instrument error, might be

# Introduction

Hydrologic monitoring for research and management, including monitoring
wells, piezometers, and stream discharge, often utilizes submerged pressure-transducer
measurements. These instruments are easy to deploy, require minimum access to
the instrument, and on-board datalogging provides long-term continuous records in
an easily analyzed format. These instruments have been developed in two major
configurations: absolute or unvented, and gauge or vented. Absolute transducers measure
pressure relative to some fixed pressure contained on one side of a flexible
membrane. Gauge transducers measure pressure across a similar membrane relative to
a chamber connected to the atmosphere via a vent tube. Speaking generally of
pressure transducers in hydrologic monitoring, it has been pointed out that
"these systems commonly are not adequately supported by quality-assurance
procedures." [@freeman-2004, p. 1]. Freeman [-@freeman-2004] went on to
highlight water temperature gradients as a source of error, and in the same year Cain
[-@cain-2004] examined temperature-derived artifacts within gauge transducers.
Within absolute transducers artifacts were shown to be the result of the
temperature of instrument [@moore-2016], as well as of differing thermal regimes
between barometric and water pressure instruments [@cuevas-2010;
@mclaughlin-2011]. Moore [-@moore-2016] goes on to suggest that suggests that 
all transducers be tested for inaccuracies over the range of temperature 
measurements and individual compensation equations be developed to apply to collected data.

McLaughlin [-@mclaughlin-2011] found that temperature differentials between 
water and barometric pressure measurements introduced detectable artifacts showing a 1.5 cm
increase in the diurnal variation. These results are similar to @cuevas-2010,
who found a 19% increase in streamflow diurnal fluctuation when barometric and
water transducers were deployed in different thermal settings. Both McLaughlin
[-@mclaughlin-2011] and Cuevas [-@cuevas-2010] focused on absolute transducers,
but similar work has also been performed using vented gauge transducers. The
findings of @cain-2004, that temperature changes within the vent-tube of gauge
pressure transducers introduce water level artifacts, was explored further by
Liu [-@liu-2015] in multi-day laboratory and long-term field experiments. Their 
findings show that the temperature differentials can be an important source of
error in water level readings from gauge transducers. They also highlight the 
impact of rate of temperature change, with more rapid gradients inducing larger
water level errors. This is supported for absolute and gauge transducers, which 
both rely on equilibrium temperatures within internal electronics and membranes
[@freeman-2004].

Implied in the above studies is additional error, beyond instrument accuracy,
that should consered in the estimate of total measurement uncertainty. For both
absolute and guage transducers there are three potential sources of uncertainty, the 
air temperature (barometric tranducer), the water temperature (water tranducer) and the
temperature difference between the two. Previous studies have looked at absolute
transducer error due to individual transducer error [@moore-2016] and due
temperature differences between tranducers [@mclaughlin-2011]. To date no study
has examined the interaction of these two effects on water level errors. We
believe that may be the result of opposite effect directions. The two effects
can counteract one another, keeping the water level within instrument accuracy
bounds while still displaying clear trends and/or hysteresis loops, thus hiding
the errors from casual inspection (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-1)). This is
supported by Liu and Higgins [-@liu-2015, p. 72] who in their conclusion state
that "measurement of the water level...is not simple".

```{r figure-1, fig.cap="Figure 1: Water level error as function of water temperature recorded by the instrument. The line sequential connects the data point and the line color indicates the temperature difference between the water and air. The black point represents the start of the experimental period with a clockwise hystersis loop. The dashed lines represent the combined errors of the water pressure transducer and F3311 barometric sensor."}

Looking at the studies above, it is clear to see that temperature-induced errors
are most apparent in field data when examining diurnal signals.
Evapotranspiration and groundwater flow have been estimated by the diurnal
signal in well water levels and streamflow [@carlsonmazur-2014; @kirchner-2009;
@loheide-2005; @mclaughlin-2014; @watras-2017; @white-1932]. Because these 
finding serve as a basis for other research and modeling efforts, errors in
diurnal signals will lead to additional skewed results. Therefore, correcting
for temperature-induced errors is essential to ensure that the observed
fluctuations are real and not an artifact. Cuevas [-@cuevas-2010] and Gribovszki
[-@gribovszki-2013] do validate their measurements with manual readings over the
course of at least one 24-hour period. However, to be fully effective in field
studies, these types of diurnal fluctuation validations would have to happen
across the range of temperature and evapotranspiration/groundwater measurements
throughout the monitoring period. This is often unfeasible for reasons related,
but not limited to, budget, logistics, and safety. This leaves laboratory-derived
compensation equations as the best alternative option, as recommended by Moore
[-@moore-2016] and Liu [-@liu-2015].

While compensation equations can provide more assurance that observed diurnal
signals are real, no studies to date examining the combined impact of instrument
and compensation errors to estimate the full uncertainty of measurements. Even
the relatively simple task of measuring water level in a tank may be masked by
propagating instrument uncertainty through to final water levels [@tamari-2010].
Therefore instrument error, and any uncertainty in correcting the intra- and
inter-tranducer artifacts, should be propagated through to the final water level
record. Such propagated uncertainty will provide a detection limit for true
diurnal signals. Without additional validation (through manual measurements or
other instrumentation), diurnal patterns below this detection limit must be
considered artifacts. As such we suggest that estimates of diurnal signal should
be analyzed as a left-censored dataset, with the detection limit determined by
the specifics of instrumentation and compensation equations.

In this note we present a lab experiment to isolate and model the separate
impacts of intra- and inter-tranducer temperature response. We demonstrate how
these effects may mask one another resulting in water level errors within the
range of instrument error. We present the corrected and uncorrected water levels
on a test set of laboratory data at as well representative data from an ongoing
hydrologic field study. Finally we calculate the propagated uncertainty, compare
this to instrument error, and evaluate both against published diurnal water
level fluctuations.

# Materials and Methods

## Data Collection & Preparation

We have conducted four experiments to determine the direct impact of temperature
regimes and differentials on water and barometric pressure measurements. The
experiments represent a fully crossed design with stable and variable
temperatures and similar and dissimilar air and water thermal regimes (Table \@ref(tab:experiments)). Eighteen
pressure transducers of varying age and model, all manufactured by Solinst, Ltd.
(Georgetown, ON, Canada), were used to record water levels
(Table \@ref(tab:loggers)). Two of these transducers, both Solinst Levellogger Juniors,
were used to monitor barometric pressure. All instruments contained an absolute
pressure transducer, temperature sensor, on-board data logging and attempt to
provide internal temperature compensation on temperature measurements. Reference
barometric pressure was obtained from the Automatic Position Reporting System WX
NET/Citizen Weather Observer Program station F3311. Station F3311 is located 3
km away and 77m higher than the study location. Data for the study period were
retrieved using the Synoptic Mesonet API
(https://developers.synopticdata.com/mesonet/v2/). Station F3311 is equipped with
a Ambient Weather WS-2080 Weather Station (Ambient Weather, Chandler, AZ, USA)

```{r experiments}

  data.table(Experiment = c("stat-sim", "stat-dis", "var-sim", "var-dis", "test-data"),
             Temperature = c("Stable", "Stable", "Variable", "Variable", "Variable"),
             `Air/Water Temperature Differential` = c("Similar", "Dissimilar", "Similar", "Dissimilar", "Dissimilar"))

knitr::kable(experiments,
             align = "c",

             caption = "Summary of pressure transducer model type and associated errors. __ADD MEASUREMENT RESOLUTION__ Do summary table by logger type and count of loggers instead of serial numbers")
```

Water level transducers were suspended from a brace across a large container with
the transducers zero points aligned.
The transducers were covered with a fixed depth of water and a layer of canola oil
was added to prevent evaporation over the length of the experiment. Water level
was measured at the start and end of experimental period to confirm no
evaporation. To provide thermally similar air and water environments we placed a
graduated cylinder in the center of the water. The cylinder was partially filled
with gravel and water to counteract the buoyancy of the cylinder. During the two
experiments with synchronous thermal regimes the two barometric transducers were
suspended directly above the gravel surface. The entire apparatus was covered
loosely with aluminum foil to prevent direct wind effects. For stable thermal
regimes the experiments were conducted in a non-climate controlled basement to
minimize temperature fluctuations. Varying thermal regime experiments were conducted
outdoors, out of direct solar radiation. The barometric transducers were placed
under a black radiation shield to magnify temperature differentials and purposely
induce noise from rapid temperature fluctuations [@liu-2015]. A test set of data
collected under variable, dissimilar conditions was collected to evaluate the
compensation models.

Transducers were deployed and data retrieved using using Solinst Levellogger v.
4.4.0 software. Transducers were set to record at 1-minute intervals with time
synchronized to computer time at launch. The four experiments were run serially
without retrieving data from the Transducers A settling time of at least 30
minutes was observed after barometric tranducers or entire experimental apparatus
were relocated. Exact experiment start and end times were determined in a
post-hoc manner to remove periods of extreme rates of temperature change when
water or barometric tranducers were repositioned as this introduces known
additional errors [@liu-2015].

All data processing and analysis was performed in R [@rcoreteam-2019] using the
packages `data.table` [@dowle-2019] for data manipulation, `ggplot2`
[@wickham-2016] and `patchwork` [@pedersen-2019a] for visualization, `mcp`
[@lindelov-2020] for change point analysis, and `httr` [@wickham-2019a] for
Mesonet API access and caching. The `drake` [@landau-2018], `rmarkdown`
[@allaire-2020; @xie-2018], `rticles` [@allaire-2019], and `rbbt`
[@dunnington-2020] packages were used to generate a reproducible project and
publication.

## Pressure Transducer Compensation

All of the sensors used in this study are designed to measure pressure at a
relatively constant temperature and utilize a fixed water density of 1000 $kg
m^{-3}$ to convert pressure to depth (Personal Communication, Solinst). To
account for the larger range of temperatures observed in this study the recorded
pressure was adjusted to account for the variable density of water.
$$h_{r} = h\;\mathsf{x}\;\frac{1000}{\rho_T}$$ 
where $\rho_T$ is the density of water as a function of temperature taken from
[@tanaka-2001, Eq. 1]. For all models specified below compensation of pressure 
errors were not applied when a model slope was not significant at the $\alpha$=0.05
level.

### Barometric Pressure

For barometric transducers, we fit an ordinary least squares regression between the
barometric error ($\epsilon_a = P_{a} - P_{F3311}$) and air temperature. While the tranducers
were moved during the study their position relative to F3311 and each other
shifted slightly. To align the data across experiments, data from each
experiment and tranducer were shifted by the difference of mean pressure of that
experiment and *var-dis* within the same air temperature range (Figure \@ref(fig:baro-alignment)).
Barometric pressure errors were aligned to *var-dis* because *var-dis*
conditions most closely correlate to F3311 conditions (outdoors, open to the
air).

```{r baro-alignment, fig.cap = "Error in barometric pressure relative to an external station for tranducer 1065861. Panel A represents raw error values, and panel B represent aligned error values. Error values were aligned within tranducers by the difference in mean pressure between an experiment and *var-dis* mean pressure within the same range of air temperature."}

knitr::include_graphics("../output/figures/figure_2.png")

```

Temperature compensation models were applied to $P_a$ using equation 3
in Moore [-@moore-2016]. Temperature-compensated air pressure was then used to
calculate an updated $\epsilon_a$. We observed a trend between the updated 
$\epsilon_a$ and rate of temperature change ($\Delta T^oC\;min^{-1}$). A second OLS regression
was fit to all observations where $abs(\Delta T) > 0.05$, where 0.05 is
half of the temperature resolution of these tranducers ($0.1 ^oC$). These rapid
shifts also result in an offset in recorded pressure, likely the result of a
delay in the internal components equilibrating to the new temperature
[@freeman-2004]. This shift can be removed by applying the cumulative impact of
the $\Delta T$ model. 

Following compensation for $\Delta T$, we compared updated $\epsilon_a$ visually 
to $T_a$, $\Delta T_a$, and the temperature difference between the transducer
and F3311 air temperatures. With no trends remaining the authors feel confident
that systemic artifacts have been addressed.

### Water Pressure

Water pressure error $\epsilon_w$ was calculated as the difference between recorded pressure
and the sum of the known water depth and sea level pressure at F3311 ($\epsilon_w\;=\;P_w - (D_w + SLP_{F3311})$. Sea level 
pressure calculations adjust absolute pressure to address the varying
lapse rates of atmospheric density due to temperature and elevation **CITATION**.
Accounting for these lapse rates provides a more accurate measure of the actual
atmospheric pressure at the water surface. Error rates were correlated with the
water temperature ($T_w$) and temperature difference ($\Delta T_{a,w}$) 
between the water and air ($T_a$). Examining the data show that 
$\Delta T_{a,w}$ was the controlling factor, creating hysteresis loops and 
non-linearity in the relationship with $T_w$ (Figure 3). 

```{r water-error-drivers, fig.cap = "Water pressure error as a function of (A) temperature difference ($T_{air} - T_{water}$) and (B) water temperature for tranducer. Water pressure errors have been aligned to *stat-sim* errors"}

knitr::include_graphics("../output/figures/figure_3.png")

```

We fit an OLS linear regression between $\epsilon_w$ and $\Delta T_{a,w}$ for
each water transducer. Prior to fitting, the regression data between
experiments were aligned as for barometric tranducers (above) using *stat-sim* as
the reference. Data from *stat-sim* were used because stable water temperatures
result in perceived trends that are only the result of $\Delta T_{a,w}$. Using the
temperature-differential models water pressure was compensated and $\epsilon_w$
was updated. Almost all tranducers now showed a clear linear relationship between
$\epsilon_w$ and $T_w$. For these tranducers an OLS was fit, but for two tranducers
2030899 and 2064734, there was a breakpoint in the relationship between 
$\epsilon_w$ and $T_w$ (Figure \@ref(fig:water-temps)). For these tranducers changepoint analysis was 
performed to identify the breakpoint using a fixed intercept and variance and 
varying slopes (Figure 5).

```{r water-temps, fig.cap = "Water pressure error as a function of water temperature after compensation for difference between water and air temperature. Note tranducers 2030899 and 2064734 have clear breaks in the relationship."}

knitr::include_graphics("../output/figures/figure_4.png")

```

```{r mcp-mods, fig.cap = "Changepoint models for tranducers 2030899 and 2064734. Dashed lines represent 95% credibility intervals for prediction, solid lines represent posterior distribution of change point."}

knitr::include_graphics("../output/figures/figure_5.png")

```

Water temperature compensation was applied to the differential-compensated
water pressure and $\epsilon_w$ was updated. Based on tranducer model the threshold
for $\Delta T_w$ models varied between 0.00015 and 0.05 $^oC\;min^{-1}$ dependent 
on the resolution of the temperature sensor. Unlike the barometric tranducers the
$\Delta T_w$ water models did not present a persistent mean offset and the 
additional step of adding the cumulative impact was not deemed necessary.

## Compensation Evaluation

To ensure independent evaluation of compensation errors the effectiveness of
compensation was performed using the withheld test set (*test-data*) of data. The
testing data were collected under variable, dissimilar temperature regimes to
ensure that all potential compensations were employed After all necessary
compensation steps were completed we centered the rectified pressure readings by
subtracting the mean residual error within each tranducer and experiment.
Instrument compensations were evaluated based on two criteria: number of
recorded points which fell outside of the range of combined instrument errors
($n_\epsilon$) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) from the true values as a
percentage of the true value. Differences were tested using ANOVA with a
post-hoc Tukey HSD analysis to compare between correction methods.

The purpose of developing barometric and water tranducer compensations is to 
correct field-collected data where no reference pressure is available. 
To evaluate the combined performance of the compensation steps, 
fully-compensated barometric and water pressures from the *test-data* dataset 
were used to calculate water level. The evaluation metrics of $n_\epsilon$ and 
MAD were calculated and compared against naive water level calculation and water 
level calculated from rectified water pressure and external barometric pressure. 

For further validation, representative data from ongoing field research using 
these instruments is evaluated using raw and compensated water and air pressure.
These data are from a site in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan in sites
located in black ash wetlands. Details on the hydrology of these sites can be
found in Van Grinsven _et al_ [-@vangrinsven-2017]. The data used in this analysis
are from well water levels collected from a 1.25" driven monitoring well driven 
and a 6" parshall flume on an intermittent stream which serves as the outflow of
this headwater wetland. Well level, flume level, and barometric data were 
collected with instruments ######, ######, and ###### respectively. To stay 
within the scope of this article just one week of data were chosen for each
water source. As these periods only include one manual measurement each, 
calculating error metrics were not calculated. Rather the quality of the 
resulting time series is evaluated qualitatively with an emphasis on timing of
water level peaks and drawdown.

## Uncertainty Analysis

The two evaluation metrics above were calculated for each tranducer and for each
experimental period for the raw recorded pressure and the rectified pressure.
Intermediate steps in the compensation were evaluated in the same manner to
quantify the relative error introduced from each source of error. We also
present a full accounting of the uncertainty of water levels derived from
compensated readings. A hierarchical Bayesian model encompassing all of the water and
barometric compensation steps was constructed to calculate water level for the
test data set. For this model each observation is considered to come from a
normally distributed dataset centered on the recorded value with a standard
deviation derived from the stated accuracy and precision of the instruments.
Within the model the results of each compensation are fed into the subsequent
step, propagating the uncertainty from instrument error to final compensated
pressure. This analysis was performed in Stan. This model is applied to the 
*test-data* dataset for comparison to derived compensations. The model is then
applied to the selected field data and the magnitude of diurnal fluctuations 
seen throughout a growing season.

# Results

There was a storm that came through, could have strong pressure gradient
One barologger found resting on gravel/in water in cylinder during variable,
similar experiment.

# Conclusions
Could need a greater range of temperatures during var-sim to really check for
temperature impacts.

When correcting the barometric data knowing the air temperature difference is
important because it provides the threshold for usable data for the correction
models. You can then discard the data where temperature difference is above the
threshold and expect your final predictions to have higher errors where
temperature difference is greater.


Highlight areas where different artifacts are present. Then it can be a guide for
where people should at their data to find artifacts.

Separate out sensor-specific corrections vs generic corrections. Do any appear
to be

**Why Perform these Corrections?**
One could argue that it’s not worth the additional uncertainty for a reduction
in points outside of the measurement error range. There are three arguments
against this. The first is the idealistic argument that we should want the
correct data for the correct reason. Have measurements stay within the error
bounds due to competing biases is not a good strategy from an idealistic or a
pragmatic view. The points that are most likely to lie outside of the error
bounds have the greatest temperature difference between tranducers or show the
fastest rate of change. These are often significant events: changes in flow
following a storm or periods of peak ET where water temperature and air
temperature are likely to be at their maximum. Building on these two reasons is
that an understanding of the true uncertainty of  measured data will allow more
critical and accurate interpretation. How strong are the diurnal signals in
relation to known uncertainty.



Temperature compensation could be overstated based on the time scale of the
study. Would have to know how quickly Solinst changes temperatures in their
calibrations. [@freeman-2004] talks about this stating that it could be a rate
of change issue and/or the fact that parts of the electronics may change
temperatures at different times. Relatedly, it is important to note that these
rapid temperature changes were short-lived and the offset of the $\Delta T$
models may decline over time much as an intervention effect in a time series
model. We tested this on inter-experiment data excluded from this analysis and
found that ... (move from outside to inside for stat-dis and the long gradual
decrease in temperature after a short rapid change)

The authors have chosen to focus on trend correction rather than offset. In 
general systematic offsets are corrected through manual calibration measurements
during deployment. If deployed conditions will not allow for manual calibration
measurements, the above approaches are applicable, but offsets must be carefully
calculated. This will involve know the exact elevation difference between 
the instrument supplying reference pressure measurements and pressure transducers
during calibration.

I cannot compare if the water level errors are of fixed magnitude or percentage
based. I could make some educated guess from the barometric tranducers though.

## Recommendations

- We have shown that even with the added uncertainty of rectified barometric
pressure we can provide water level compensations that match those from an
external, reference source. However it is important that during data processing
other stations were found to have different slopes for temperature correction 
models. For use in future work it is recommended that the relationship be 
developed individually for any external stations that may be used to back-fill
missing experimental or monitoring data. Or inversely that back-fill sources
are corrected to match your pressure transducers.

- For each new tranducer check for *all* potential error-inducing sources. Each 
tranducer should be checked for temperature gradients, temperature difference
gradients to reference values, and rate of change of temperature or pressure

- In this study no mean offset was necessary to account for persistent pressure
errors due to rapid water temperature changes. This is likely because of the
buffered $\Delta T_w$ relative to $\Delta T_a$. In setting where rapid changes
in water temperature are possible calibration should consider including a
persistent impact.
